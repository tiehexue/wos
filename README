It is intended to polish one OS specialized to VM or container. There should be plenty of small os for the purpose, and this one is just for fun and lucky.

Here is the plan:
1. Learning 32-bit os development
1.1 boot
1.2 basic os kernel, e.g. memory, process, file sytem.
1.3 port libc

2. Upgrade to 64-bit.
2.1 KVM.
2.2 Container functionality.

3. Distributed OS
3.1 network functionality
3.2 distributed OS

4. Hardware optimization
Link servers as super-computer.

Though plan is good, reality is real. It is just in 1.1, and most of code are re-typed through https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial

Hope I will become more smart to continue.
